# sixtytranslator
Small meme program I made. Transcribes letters to noise boxes.

If you're not used to getting stuff on Github, there are two ways you can download my program:
- click the green "Code" button on the top right, and click "Download ZIP", then extract the ZIP wherever you like.
- click on "sixtytranslator.exe", find "Download", and click it.

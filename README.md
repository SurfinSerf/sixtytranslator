# sixtytranslator
Small meme program I made. Transcribes letters to noise boxes.

If you're not used to getting stuff on Github, there are two ways you can download my program:
- click the green "Code" button on the top right, and click "Download ZIP", then extract the ZIP wherever you like.
- click on "sixtytranslator.exe", find "Download", and click it.

You don't need the .py part of this. It's just here so you can read it and be more reassured it's not malware, or you can see how it works.
It used to be cooler, but the .exe wouldn't work properly. :(
